# PrimeNumberGenerator
This prime number generator project is made up of a few classes, interface, and test cases. The main class is the
Generator.java class, which ask users for their input range of numbers to start evaluating the primes within said range.
To use application, simply use the Generator class as you would run any class with a main and give the desired range for
integers. Once the set of primes are recalculated and printed to the user, the application will reoccurringly ask if the
 user wishes to generate another set of primes in a given range until the user exits the program with N/n.
